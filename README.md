# IBM UrbanCode Deploy Resource Utilities Plug-in
---
Note: This is not the plugin distributable! This is the source code. To find the installable plugin, go into the 'release' tab, and download a stable version.

This UrbanCode Deploy plug-in suppliments the existing UrbanCode Deploy respources plugin with additional steps to help manage large resource trees and the properties on resources in large trees.

### The Resource Utilities plug-in includes the following steps:

List resources
Find resources with properties that have missing values
Search and report property values

### Compatibility
	This plug-in requires version 6.0 or later of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.

### Installation
	The packaged zip is located in the dist folder. No special steps are required for installation.
	See Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy. Download this zip file if you wish to skip the
	manual build step. Otherwise, download the entire uDeploy-Resource-Utilities-Plugin and
	run the "gradle" command in the top level folder. This should compile the code and create
	a new distributable zip within the dist folder. Use this command if you wish to make
	your own changes to the plugin.
