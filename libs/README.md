# Required Compilation Jars
    The HttpComponents-Util.jar and uDeployRestClient.jar libraries are required to build this
    plugin. We are actively working on putting these libraries on Maven Repo to enable easier
    dependency management. For the time being, these two libraries must be built or referenced
    locally. To build the Resource Utilities plug-in locally, find these two jars within your local
    IBM UrbanCode Deploy instance and place them in the "libs" directory. Run the "gradle" command.
